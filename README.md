I am a 28-year-old web developer and designer specialising in the React ecosystem. Initially focused on WordPress website creation and content management at a creative agency and as a freelancer, I've recently shifted my attention to modern frontend development and into high performance web applications.

## 👨‍💻 Passion

About 7 years ago I made my first website as a term paper for my studies. It was my first introduction to HTML and CSS, and I understood how to develop a very simple website.

It consisted of a single image, a headline, two paragraphs of text and a large background gradient across the whole page - but as small as it was and as unsightly as it looked, I had a blast creating it. And thus found a new passion.
