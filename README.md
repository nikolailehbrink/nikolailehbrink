# About me

üë®‚Äçü¶∞ Web developer and bachelor graduate of the media informatics program at the University of Applied Sciences Bremen.
Most of all I like to design and program websites. In my studies I also learned to program apps for Android and iOS and to design and build web platforms with JavaScript runtime environments like NodeJS.

üíª Alongside my studies, I worked in an advertising agency where I implemented many projects, from small websites to large online stores.
